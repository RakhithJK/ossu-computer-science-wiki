# Tools of Computer Science

**Tooling isn't CS**; it's IT.
But you still need it!

Usually, you will learn a domain-specific tool, such as the debugger for a specific language, from the particular course you are taking.
However, some tools are so universal that no single course even tries to teach them.
This section is for collecting the best resources on those tools.

## Modern Technology
Although "computer science" is mostly a branch of mathematics, most computer science courses just assume that you are going to use a computer for doing computations, and that you are quite familiar with computers.
So you should take this if you are completely new to how computers work.
However, the full Harvard CS50 course includes all this material, so there is no need to take it if you plan to use CS50 as your introductory course.

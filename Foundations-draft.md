# Foundations

This section is for housing material that is prerequisite to taking certain courses in computer science.
The material does not directly fall into the computer science field, and you should utilize it only as needed based on your level and background.

## Single-variable Calculus
AP Calculus AB should correspond to Calculus 1A and 1B.
AP Calculus BC should correspond to Calculus 1C.
If you took these courses recently in high school, we recommend using Expii Calculus 1 to test yourself and see if you need more review.
If you never took those courses or it's been a long time, we suggest diving straight into MIT Calculus 1A through 1C.

## Linear Algebra
Gilbert Strang's material on linear algebra is perhaps the most widely praised on this topic, but his course MIT Linear Algebra assumes not only that you have access to MATLAB but also that you already have an advanced background in math.
You should take Strang's course if you meet these requirements; you will find LAFF too slow and boring otherwise.
For everyone else, we recommend taking LAFF (which is also widely praised), which only assumes high school math and provides you with MATLAB Online through the use of the course.

LAFF includes optional programming assignments, although the instructors don't assume a background in programming.
If you are taking linear algebra *before* moving onto the computer science curriculum, and you don't have any background in programming, feel free to skip these assignments if you wish.
If you have already taken any programming courses, consider the programming assignments to be required.

## Modern Technology
Although "computer science" is mostly a branch of mathematics, most computer science courses just assume that you are going to use a computer for doing computations, and that you are quite familiar with computers.
So you should take this if you are completely new to how computers work.
However, the full Harvard CS50 course includes all this material, so there is no need to take it if you plan to use CS50 as your introductory course.

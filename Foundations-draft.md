# Foundations

This section is for housing material that is prerequisite to taking certain courses in computer science.
The material does not directly fall into the computer science field, and you should utilize it only as needed based on your level and background.

## Single-variable Calculus
The best online courses for this subject are MIT Calculus 1A through 1C.
If you prefer an interactive textbook format, Ximera Calculus 1-2 is the most comprehensive.

*Calculus Made Easy* is strongly recommended as the first resource for those who find the subject intimidating, but it is neither interactive nor comprehensive.

AP Calculus AB should correspond to Calculus 1A and 1B.
AP Calculus BC should correspond to Calculus 1C.
If you took these courses recently in high school, we recommend using Expii Calculus 1 to test yourself and see if you need more review.
If you never took those courses or it's been a long time, we suggest diving straight into MIT Calculus 1A through 1C.

An alternative for those seeking a purely text-based approach is to follow the Ximera Calculus 3 interactive textbook.

### Needed by
- Probability
- Linear Algebra (Advanced track)

## Linear Algebra
Those who are brand new to linear algebra and who only have a background in high school math or single-variable calculus should take the Beginner track.
Note that the textbook by Boyd and Vandenberghe does not contain all the topics of a full course on linear algebra, so if you choose to learn linear algebra exclusively by textbook you may need to transition to another resource later, such as Jim Hefferson's textbook from the Advanced track.
However, as not all of linear algebra is necessarily used in every course, a more pragmatic approach to this problem might be to attempt taking the course that requires linear algebra and seeing what topics you are actually missing for understanding the course content, and then selectively learning those topics as needed.

If your math background is already very strong (i.e. through multivariable calculus), or you have some experience in linear algebra, you may find the Beginner track too slow or easy.
In this case you could consider the Advanced track, which consists of Gilbert Strang's materials (e.g., MIT Linear Algebra).
However, Strang's textbook is not available for free and his course requires you have access to MATLAB.
If you do not wish to buy Strang's textbook, you could try using Hefferson's free textbook.
And it may be possible to use [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) instead of MATLAB, but we have not tested this option.

Gilbert Strang's material on linear algebra is perhaps the very best on this topic, so if you are planning to study advanced topics in linear algebra, you may want to look at Advanced after Beginner.

If you have already studied linear algebra but it's been a long time, the Advanced track contains a review/reference text.
Go through the text and confirm that you are familiar with everything on there.
Whenever you find you have forgotten something, go through Strang's online course to find that material and review it.

[*immersive linear algebra*](http://immersivemath.com/ila/) (J. Ström, K. Åström and T. Akenine-Möller) is an interesting, but incomplete interactive textbook.
We suggest bookmarking it for future reference.

## Probability
The MIT Probability course is much more in-depth than one would need for much of computer science, but it would be critical for those who are going into data science.

Our discrete mathematics materials will also teach some probability, which may be sufficient for some computer science students;
however, it might be necessary to supplement knowledge of discrete probability using some of the other resources here.

## Modern Technology
Although "computer science" is mostly a branch of mathematics, most computer science courses just assume that you are going to use a computer for doing computations, and that you are quite familiar with computers.
So you should take this if you are completely new to how computers work.
However, the full Harvard CS50 course includes all this material, so there is no need to take it if you plan to use CS50 as your introductory course.

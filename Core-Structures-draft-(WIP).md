# Core Structures

## Prerequisites
- Foundations Single-variable Calculus
- Core Computing Systems

## Resources

### Discrete Mathematics
- Math for CS

### Algorithms and Data Structures
- TODO: May need intermediate material. Core Computing Systems teaches basic concrete data structures like arrays and lists but we may need some material here on simple abstract structures that don't get covered by Stanford Algorithms
- [Stanford Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part I](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about)
- [Stanford Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part II](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms2+SelfPaced/about)

### Databases
- "[Architecture of a Database System](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf)"
- [Stanford Databases](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about)

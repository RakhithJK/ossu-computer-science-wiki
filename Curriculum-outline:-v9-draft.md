Summary of changes
- New section Foundations houses all non-CS prerequisite content
- Intro CS is now a "wildcard" (students' choice) section, meaning it isn't required to teach a specific language or set of concepts
- Old Core Theory renamed to Core Structures
- The old Advanced Theory is the new Core Theory
- The new Advanced Theory now covers advanced complexity theory and advanced type theory
- Core/Advanced Math collapsed into Core/Advanced Structures
- New category: Core/Advanced Software Engineering, focusing on large-scale system architecture and formal verification
- New category: Core/Advanced Distributed Systems, focusing on information theory, networks and other distributed systems, and distributed programming

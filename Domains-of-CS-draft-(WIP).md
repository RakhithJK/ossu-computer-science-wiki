# Domains of Computer Science

Pure computer science is ultimately only useful if you intend to become a theorist.
Otherwise, your next step after learning the fundamentals of computer science is to specialize in a domain.
This section helps guide you towards such a domain, but it should not be considered complete.
Mastery of any of these domains takes many years and this is just a starting point to transition you out of this curriculum and into the real world.

## How to use this section

After you finish Core CS, your next step is to take electives from Advanced CS.
You can either just take whatever interests you and decide on a Domain later, or you can immediately choose a Domain listed below and base your elective selections on the prerequisites of the Domain.

Note that some Domains may depend on others.

### Relation to other OSSU curricula

OSSU already has curricula for [Data Science](https://github.com/ossu/data-science) and [Bioinformatics](https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics).
(There is a repository for [Game Development](https://github.com/ossu/game-development) but this curriculum has not yet been developed.)
Students should immediately switch to these curricula as soon as they realize that these are the fields they are interested in.

However, some subdomains of these other fields will have a Domain listed in this curriculum for those students who want to specialize in a particularly CS-heavy subset of a different field, such as Deep Learning (a subset of Data Science) or Computer Graphics (a subset of Game Development).

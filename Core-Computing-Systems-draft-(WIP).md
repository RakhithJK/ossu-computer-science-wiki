# Core Computing Systems

In this curriculum, we use "Computing Systems" to encompass both machine-level systems and operating systems.
We combine these two together because coursework tends to combine them together (e.g., both Nand2Tetris and Computation Structures mix the teaching of a simple operating system with hardware-focused material).

# Core Computing Systems

In this curriculum, we use "Computing Systems" to encompass both machine systems and operating systems.
The dividing layer between these two is usually a [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) that provides an abstract interface to the hardware (along with hardware drivers, which [may](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel) or [may not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel) be part of the kernel).
We combine these two together because coursework tends to combine them together (e.g., both Nand2Tetris and Computation Structures mix the teaching of a simple operating simple with hardware-focused material).
